            </header>
            <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most
                basic building block of the Web. It defines the m
                eaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besi
                des HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (C
                SS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            </p>

            <p>
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web page
                s to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
                Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it
                to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name
                surrounded by "<code><</code>" and "<code>></code>".
                The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase,
                lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code><<code>title</code>></code> tag can be written as
                <code><<code>Title</code>></code>,<code><<code>TITLE</code>></code>,
                or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

                    image</a><br>
                The <code>crossorigin</code> attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images
                defined by the <code><<code>img</code>></code> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a
                <code><<code>canvas</code>></code> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

                    attributes</a><br>
                Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <code><<code>img</code>></code> or
                <code><<code>video</code>></code>, have a <code>crossorigin</code> attribute (<code>crossorigin</code>
                property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

                    with rel="preload"</a>
                The preload value of the <code><<code>link</code>></code> element's <code>rel</code> attribute allows
                you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <code><<code>head</code>></code>, specifying
                resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start
                preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks
                in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first
                render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how
                <code>preload</code> works.
